## Project Architecture & Flow

The system is composed of:
- **User Interface (Frontend):** Modern, responsive chat and job browsing experience.
- **API Gateway (Backend Controller Layer):** Receives and routes user requests.
- **Intent Detection:** Classifies user messages to determine their intent (job search, resume advice, etc.).
- **AI Services:** Specialized services for job matching, resume analysis, job detail analysis, general Q&A, and interview simulation.
- **Database:** Stores user profiles, job data, and interview sessions.
- **External LLM Provider:** Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o) powers the agent's intelligence.
