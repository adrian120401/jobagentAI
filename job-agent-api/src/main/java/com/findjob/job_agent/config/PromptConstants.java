            Instructions:
            1. Only consider a job relevant if it shares substantial alignment with the candidate’s skills (e.g., programming languages, tools, frameworks, roles).

               - `jobId`: the job's ID
               - `matchScore`: a number between 0.0 and 1.0 indicating how well it matches
               - `reason`: a short explanation of the match (e.g., “Strong match on backend skills: Java, Spring Boot”)
